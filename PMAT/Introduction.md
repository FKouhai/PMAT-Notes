# Musts

- Safety first
In order to have a safe environment, you must have a VM with a host only adapter, preferable if that adapter is on another network segment i.e(10.0.0.0 if your network is 192.168.0.0), also having a snapshot of the VM before detonating the malware is important
- Disarm the .exe file for example appending something at the end of the .exe like .exe.malz
- Malware is usually password protected on a zip file, so the analysts knows what he's getting into
